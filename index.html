					<p class="sm-col-12 md-col-6"><strong>A) Blackwater Harbour</strong><br>You can fish from both the harbour itself and the rocks to the west of the harbour,
                     provided you check the swells. <br><strong>Species & Techniques:</strong> Spinning will take Mackerel
						in
						season, small Pollack, and there is even the possibility of a Sea-Trout.
						Ray and smaller Conger have both been caught here with bottom fished rigs.</p>
					<p class="sm-col-12 md-col-6"><strong>B) Oysterbed Pier</strong><br> A small pier, almost lost in time, but sheltered, quiet and tranquil...
                      Mind you don't nod off! Access is on the shore road - take directions from the locals in Sneem.
						<br><strong>Species & Techniques:</strong> Pier fishing for Conger on the bottom, Wrasse on a
						float,
						Mullet on both, and the chance of an odd Ray and Flatfish.</p>
					<p class="sm-col-12 md-col-6"><strong>C) Gleesk Harbour</strong><br> The handy thing about this mark, and the remaining two marks is that they face
                       onto the Kenmare River - we know it is not a river, but read the postscript and prepare to be amazed. Facing due south, even south east,
                        these marks offer good fishing out of any cold northern winds.  A word of warning - there is a dangerously blind bend on this remarkably busy
                         but terribly narrow road that requires careful navigation.  You can avail of limited parking at the pier itself, but that said, it is a lovely spot.
						<br><strong>Species & Techniques:</strong>The fishing is surprisingly mixed with Wrasse,
						Triggerfish
						and Pollack falling to float fished worms,
						Pollack and Mackerel taken on spinners, and finally Dogfish, Conger and an odd Ray apparently
						falling to bottom fishing onto the sandy patches... No reports of winter fishing here.</p>
					<p class="sm-col-12 md-col-6"><strong>D) Lamb's Head</strong><br> Another rock platform mark, this is on a spectacular piece of coastline.
						<br><strong>Species & Techniques:</strong> You will encounter all the ususal suspects including
						Pollack, Conger, Wrasse and Mackerel.
						We have reliable reports of substantial numbers of Bass arriving inshore around here in the
						early Autumn.
						Fly fishing has been shown to produce Pollack, Wrasse and even Triggerfish in the summer.</p>
					<p class="sm-col-12 md-col-6"><strong>E) Derrynane</strong><br> Another beach, tucked into a bay protected by Lamb's Head
                        and Hog's Head - do you reckon there are many vegetarians in Kerry!?! - this beach is accessed from the village and most of the way by road.
                          Quietly popular in the summer, it fishes best on the flood and near dusk.
						<br><strong>Species & Techniques:</strong> Bass and Flounder are the main quarry taken here,
						with Mullet in the estuary.
						<br><strong>Warning:  Tim Hoy</strong> has reported a lot of poisonous Lesser Weaverfish caught
						off the beach using legering techniques; check the species guide to see how to avoid their
						spines! </p>
