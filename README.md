# Guided Tours Fishing in Kenmare Bay  
This project was created with customer needs on mind and as well to promote product. For ease of passing information to 
customer I have used number of technologies.
My goal with this project is to attract attention of my future employers and recruiters and explain who I am 
and what I do. 
## Demo  
A live demo can be found [here](https://alchemist2016.github.io/Project-2/).
## UX  
### User stories
Within this project I wanted to provide clarity of purpose, natural flow of structure, and easy access to 
further informations as well interactivity between user and the website and its informations.
This website is mainly designed for prospective employers and recruiters. 

### Strategy
My goal was appealing website which provides easy as possible access to information and keeping it minimalist 
and user-friendly. Also I wanted to give a user visual orientation and information related to structure of the site.
### Scope
Allowing targeted user to get all the necessary information with the option to contact fictional company if they choose.
### Structure
In the footer I haved included links to YouTube profile, Facebook profile and Instagram.
They all link to a new page opening thus keeping the integrity of original website and ease of use.

## Technologies  
1.HTML
2.CSS3
3.Bootstrap(4.4.1) 
4.JavaScript 
5.JQuery 
6.EmailJS 
7.Google Maps API 
8.OpenWeather API
## Features  
The nav-bar and footer are used from Bootstrap with extra JavaScript for a toggle button in nav-bar. I have included back to top button also.
### Features left to implement
I would love to add more functionality regarding Google Maps API, Weather widget, better control and verification of correct use of contact us form.
## Testing  
Testing was performed on all sizes of screens and devices. Also I have performed testing on several desktop browsers like Chrome, FireFox successfully. All links in navbar are tested. 
Contact form is made in such a way that if you miss out or put invalid data in e-mail area you will be shown an error noting that you need to fill correct details. I have made a text area for Tours compulsory too.
All links will open in new tab using 'target="_blank"'. All links have been manually tested to ensure that they are pointing to the correct destination.
During the test phase I realised that some of the text rendered on pages was different color in Microsoft Edge. That is something I need to look into in the future.
## Deployment  
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. Updates are automatic with new commits. In order to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named index.html.
## Credits 
Credits to CodeInstitute for teaching me to do this cool stuff.
### Content
All content in fishing spots markers is taken from https://www.sea-angling-ireland.org/shore%20-%20kerry%20-%20ring.htm
also Google Maps API, OpenWeather API.
### Media

## Acknowledgements  
I have used some generic code from Bootstrap 4 website and then significantly modified to fit the wireframes and original ideas.
I have used Google Maps API documentation and tutorials in order to create Google Map.
I have used OpenWeather documentation and tutorials in ordet to create dynamic weather widget on my web-site.
I have used media querie from Stack Overflow tutorial [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/media-queries).
